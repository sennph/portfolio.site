				<h2>THE GHOST TOWN</h2>
				<p>The inspirsation for this piece was to capture the whimiscal feeling of when one observes an abandoned building. Many people walk pass though my mind always wanders to who has one lived here or if the building was ever loved. What moments did people have in the building those who are passing by are unable to see?</p>

				<h2>STOP MOTION-THE CAT AND THE BOY</h2>
				<p>Being my first stop motion animation, I drew inspiration from animations done by Laika Studios and Ghilbi to make a light hearted story of a boy walking down the town while a cat is constantly pestering him. I wanted it to have a personal feel therefore I decided to make an artiulating doll to be able to achieve the movements I wanted throughout the short film.</p>

				<h2>SELFISH: SHORT FILM</h2>
				<p>Being my first short film done with Premire Pro, I wanted to do something that was personal for me. Following a young artist, the audience follows her process of grief after giving up art for the sake of her mom's happiness and what it truly means to be selfish.</p>
